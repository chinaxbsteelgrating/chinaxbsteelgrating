Welded steel grating is a robust and reliable product designed for heavy-duty industrial and commercial applications. Made by welding bearing bars and crossbars to form a strong and rigid grid structure, this grating type is valued for its durability, load-bearing capacity, and versatility. Whether you need flooring for a factory, walkways in a refinery, or drainage covers, welded steel grating provides a long-lasting and cost-effective solution.

What is Welded Steel Grating?
Welded steel grating is manufactured by electrically fusing crossbars to bearing bars at their intersection points. This process creates a permanent and secure bond, ensuring high structural integrity and stability. The result is a grating product that can withstand heavy loads and harsh environments.
